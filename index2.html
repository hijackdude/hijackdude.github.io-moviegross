		<h3>Action movies makes a difference</h3>
		<p class="prose">
                It can be seen that the number of action movie gross increased from $800 million to $4 billion throughout the period. 
                Two factors attribute to the continuous rise: the deep operation of IP movies and the strong use of visual technology. 
                In 1989, action films like <i>Indiana Jones</i>and <i>The Last Crusade</i> could bring companies about $190 million and were the top three grossing films in North America,
                 while the classic comedy Home Alone grossed $280 million in 1990.
                  At that time, <i>Indiana Jones</i>was a popular and traditional style of action films. 
        </p>
        <p class="prose">
        However, action movies gradually develop towards big IP,big production and special effects in the last decade.
        For instance, <i>Star Wars</i> , on the one hand, is packaged by mature commericial work. This caused 
        a series of stuff that can play an important role in pupil's life.The audience especially born in 1980s and 90s have strong recognition for the classic elements such as lightsaber duel and darth vader in the movies.
        Once that audience has become a major consumer of the market,they're bound to make a pilgrimage to the theater to see <i>Star Wars</i> rather than a comedy,
        On the other hand, there are fewer scenes and more realistic effects. 
        Big IP effects action movies, and other movies increasingly seem not to be in the same dimension.
		</p>

		<h3>Cartoons have risen to prominence</h3>
		<p class="prose">
        Data shows that the box office of animated films has experienced a miraculous rise in the past 30 years. 
        From about $100 million in 1986 to nearly $2.5 billion in 2016. 
        This is also due to the victory of big IP+ big effects.
        In 1996, <i>Pixar</i> made toy story for Disney, 
        which became a milestone as a ranimated film. 
        Animated films have produced one classic after another for us like <i>Shrek</i>, <i>Nemo</i>.
        </p>

        <h3>Comedy stands still</h3>
        <p class="prose">
        The gross of comedies fluctuated between 1986 and 2016 when the figure for action movies rose significantly in the period.
        It is noticeable that number of comedies had decreased from 2011 to 2016. 
        What factors have caused the overall comedy box office to stagnate in the period? 
        Is there a huge problem with the development of comedies? </p>
        <p class="prose">
        To be more precisely, 
        the comedic genre films have made full use of its gross potential when other genres like action and animation are able to dig out more.
        For example, the top grossing comedy film in 1986 was <I>Back to School</I>which earned $91.25 million. As a low-cost comedy, 
        it ranked third in the box office in 2016. However, the worldwide smash hit <i>La La land</i> grossed just $150 million in 2016.

            <h3>Traditional directors</h3>
            <p class="prose">
        The Hollywood industrial system growing up in the last 30 years, 
        Spielberg is obviously the most bankable director.
        The numbers is available and accounted since 1986 when Spielberg's two well-known classics,
        <i>E.T.</i> and <i>Jaws</i> don't appear in the data list ($430 million and $270 million respectively). 
        However, he still takes the first place in the box office with more than 20 films including Saving Private Ryan, 
        <i>Minority Report</i> and <i>Jurassic park</i>. Audience have been appreciating him for a long period.
         </p>
		<p class="prose">
		
James Cameron (no. 4) is a gold-medal directors. James Cameron has directed two significant hits,
<i>Titanic</i> and <i>>Avatar</i> in the period while the number of movies that Spielberg make comes to 17 respectively.
Luckily, there will be three consecutive <i>Avatar</i> sequels coming out in 2020, 2022 and 2024. 
It is noticeable that with his great reputation, there is no doubt that he's just the director who is able to bring every generations to theaters.

        </p>
        <h3>Big I.P directors</h3>
		<p class="prose">
                Peter Jackson, Michael bay and David Yates represent another directing style. 
                They directed a series of hits. Peter Jackson built Middle Earth, earning him fame and fortune. 
		</p>
		<p class="prose">	
                Bay's previous films, such as <i>Island</i> and <i>Island of the Clones</i>, 
                are also successful in the box office and made him one of the top directors in Hollywood.
                <i>Transformers</i> earned him $1.6 billion and propelled him to no. 2. 
                 However, critics have gradually overdrawn his reputation. 
                 In 2016, he won the Golden Raspberry Award for the worst director. </p>
        <p class="prose">David yates is the most extreme case. He did not have any influential works before harry potter. 
            His <i>Harry Potter</i> movies didn't have the kind of critical acclaim that <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> did, 
            but they did make money.

Iron man is no. 1, black widow is no. 3, and director of S.H.I.E.L.D. is no. 5.
Iron man , Robert downey jr. , has become the highest-grossing actor in the last 30 years. 
Is this a reflection of their personal box office appeal? Or a triumph for the marvel cinematic universe?
 In fact, they didn't come to the list before they appeared in the marvel unicverse, 
		 </p>
		 <p class="prose">
There is, of course, a case to be made for heroes based on the box office. 
Hollywood's biggest stars: Tom cruise, Tom Hanks, 
Johnny Depp and Bradley cooper are all on the list. 
But we found that in terms of the box office,
 the Yin and Yang decline phenomenon is particularly serious.

           However, we analyzed the correlation between the two variables by math tools. 
           In fact, the correlation coefficient of the two variables was only 0.16.

Many of the highest-grossing movies are at a vote of 5-7.
It is noticeable that there are almost no points at the top left of the table, 
and there's a magic line that comes out of the table,
   At the same time, if you look closely at the scatter plot,
    you will find that the highest box office of the movie with the same score increases as the score gradually increases.</p>
    <p class='prose'>
It reminds us that vote may not necessarily have a significantly positive correlation on box office. 
A high score doesn't necessarily mean a high box office. 
A low score doesn't necessarily mean a high box office.
 That's a bit harsh for our filmmakers, isn't it?

        Why we made this
        </p>
        <p class='prose'>

                We hope that such data analysis can help both readers and filmmakers.
                 We hope that people who love movies will have a more objective understanding of what is happening in the film industry and where the film industry is going. 
                We are eager to help filmmaker to analyze the industry's ecology more accurately.
        </p>
        <p class='prose'>
                Through data analysis, our answer is that the mature film industry system will help the movie box office to improve like the big I.P system. 
                Although we used to think that the vote counts a lot on box office with other factors like the personal charm of the actors counting similarly.
                 they have not been able to work as well as before. 
                 Series films such as <i>Marvel Universe</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, are getting higher box office than before,
                 The big IP comes from the planning of the mature editing teams, and the continued commercial work.
                 And the powerful special effects are even more inseparable from a mature technical team. 
                 In the face of such a powerful film production line, 
                 warm-hearted comedies like <i>Little Ghosts</i> are increasingly lacking box office competitiveness.
                 Whatever the film industry will bring to us, the fact is that viewers are increasingly looking at mature industrial products.
